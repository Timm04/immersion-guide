# Lead In

## The idea behind the prerequisites

To explain what immersion is I think it's best to look at what you're already familiar with and lead from there to what immersion is. I want to do this by showing you a language learning method you are most familiar with; the traditional classroom method.

From there I want to show you how it performs and fails for language acquisition, giving you reasons not to practice it while providing you with another, better option you can take; the native approach.

With the native approach I would like you to realize that this method "Immersion" is not that different to what we are doing on an everyday basis already. We basically optimize it for our needs.
