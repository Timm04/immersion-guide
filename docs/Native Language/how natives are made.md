## How natives acquire their language

I want you to ask yourself how you learned your native language, how does everyone learn their native language?
This goes all the way back to the moment when we were born. Ever since birth we were surrounded by our native language. Be it by television, people talking, seeing how it looks like to trying uttering our first words, our whole environment didn’t give us any other chance but to be surrounded or I should rather say immersed in our native language.
In such an environment we had no choice but to acquire the language naturally in its **purest and rawest form**. We basically adapted to the environment we were put in and actually excelled.

To foreigners our native language might be illogical or difficult to understand certain nuances in vocab or grammar while for us natives it doesn’t even require a real mental effort to conjugate or speak or understand even the little peculiarities. 

For example a native german person who has lived their whole life in Germany and only spoke german wouldn't have a problem differentiating and knowing when to use any of the 16 different article forms while a foreigner who could be coming from the US and only knew English would have a hard time wrapping their mind around the idea why a language would even need 16 articles and why not just use one definite articles like *the* in the english language. Not to speak of how a Japanese person would have the same kind of problem understanding why even use a definite article to begin with since the Japanese language doesn't have an article. 

Learning a language is heavily influenced by culture and to natives who embody that things like these peculiarities don't bother or face them since it's just **ingrained** into them because they didn’t know it otherwise. Their brains were basically programmed to understand their native language hence they are so good at it.

In the previous chapter we have come up with a framework to evaluate language learning methods. These are the following:
1. You actually acquire the language to your desired level.
2. The time it takes to reach 1.
3. The fun you're having.
