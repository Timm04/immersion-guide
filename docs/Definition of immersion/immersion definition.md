## Distinction between the native approach and immersion

Unlike how natives learned their language, where they were constantly surrounded by their language physically, not necessarily understanding, contents that native speakers of the language would also consume, **immersion** adds one condition: the material i.e the input you immerse in is understandable enough for you to be enjoyable and challenging. Natives were often exposed to high ambiguity and low comprehension whereas with immersion we set ourselves up for success by immersing only with material thats comprehensible enough for us to learn from. 

Think of the *native approach* as being thrown into a water, where you're being put into an environment where you forced to *swim* in the language i.e immerse in it, much like how we naturally acquired our native tongue as children. However **immersion** is more like easing your way into the water gradually with floaties keeping you afloat. You're still in the water, but supported at the right level so you can actually learn to swim.

The same way how we grew up while being surrounded by our native language and becoming so proficient in it, **immersion** also does the same but **faster, more efficiently and enjoyable**. It's an improved form. In a way, you reading this guide is you doing immersion in English, because it's written for natives of the English language, its comprehensible for you and at least a bit interesting since you are reading this.

## What Immersion tries to achieve

Immersion is by design aiming to make you reach native level in your target language. By consistently following it you will pick up the language as well as nuances in grammar, word usage, pronunciation and readings without you having realized you learned them consciously. Most of the time while immersing you don't realize or feel like you are actually learning something, but you actually are, albeit unconsciously. You probably heard of the brain being referred to as a sponge and we are capitalizing on that with immersion, where we consistently expose ourself to the language in large comprehensible amounts for our brain to acquire the language naturally. 

People who are doing immersion or have done it for a long time describe that after time a certain feeling. That words just feel more right than others in certain contexts, that this conjugation is done like this and that some word has this nuanced meaning. Using and understanding your target language becomes effortless and more of a feeling based on **intuition** which is the highest level of proficiency one can achieve; that is native level. The same way you can feel out what feels and sounds right in your native language is trying to be accomplished with immersion. Through doing tons of immersion you start to *accept* how things are and base your understanding on feelings and vibes because it's the same way people learn their native languages, it's just naturally ingrained into our brains through **consistent exposure.**

What we consistently expose ourselves to is hereby the most important part, it has to be **comprehensible enough and enjoyable**, but how would that help us?

## The additional condition

When doing immersion it cannot be understated that what ever you're immersing with has to be **comprehensible enough and enjoyable**. This is because these two factors act like acceleration quirks in an engine. They accelerate language acquisition. Without these two, immersion would be just consuming content without necessarily understanding which means we would be exposed to immersion material that might be too easy or too hard for us to learn anything from, thus *wasting* our time and maybe even get discouraged because we are not making any substantial progress. By adding the *filter* of choosing material thats just at our level we can progress and acquire the language faster. 

Choosing immersion material that is also enjoyable for you **makes your time learning the target language easier**. It shifts your mind from "I have to read this book to learn my target language" to "I want to sit down and read this book because its interesting." Without it, the learning process will feel forced and dragged which should be avoided at all cost. The moment when something is not interesting to you, you should stop bothering with it and switch to something different to immerse in. That is because enjoyment keeps you going, without you would be forcing yourself which is not the ideal mind space to be in when learning any skill. Somebody that enjoys what they are doing will outperform anyone that is doing the same but with no enjoyment. Ideally enjoyment should motivate you.

These two factors make up the bottom line when choosing what to immerse in. How you actually choose immersion material and in what proportions these two factors should inter play will be discussed later on in # How to choose what to immerse in. For now I want you to take away the following.

## Key takeaways

- Immersion is engaging i.e immersing with material in your target language made by natives for natives. Basically the same things a native would consume we try to consume as well. Hereby we don't choose just any immersion material but material thats **comprehensible and enjoyable** for us. What this actually means for us will be discussed in the next section.

- Immersion also has to be done **consistently** to work. Just like any skill, you need to consistently use it to not forget it.

The next section will focus on when and how to start doing immersion.
