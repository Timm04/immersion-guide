## How to Navigate This Guide

Every section includes a summary of the topics at the top that will be discussed in that section. You can read the summary first to get an overview or last to check your understand depending on what you like most. You can use the summaries for quickly referencing topics as well. Feel free to jump around the guide! 

I would recommend you to read the guide chronologically top to bottom down, to learn the main ideas first before they are being expanded upon later. 

If you have any questions regarding this guide or it's contents, feel free to DM me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/250351201923629058).

Enjoy the journey.
