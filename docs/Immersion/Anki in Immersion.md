# Anki in Immersion

## How to use Anki for Immersion

You will never not forget information. To put it more simply one will always forget things. Thats the baseline of how things are. If you learn something then do nothing with it you will eventually forget it. Thats why we need Anki to remember things in the long term. 

Anki is there to supplement your immersion by having you learn expressions you mined in an efficient manner that is Anki's spaced repetition system.
The key idea is you **learn** an expression in Anki and **acquire** it with Immersion afterwards. We differentiate here between learning and acquiring because you apply what you learn from Anki with immersion. Then through immersing consistently **only then** will that *learned* expression be **acquired** by seeing it be used in many different contexts. When something is acquired it will stick in your brain and you hardly forget it. It's the same with your native language where you can understand and remember a huge amount of words because you have seen them so many times in so many different contexts. With immersion we are trying to mimic that which can only happen if we learn new words every day in Anki. Anki is the fuel for your immersion.

Anki and Immersion are not two separate processes. What you learn in Anki will only be useful to you when you actually see it be used in immersion. 
Anki alone won't make you learn a language.
Anki doesn't replace your immersion.

## How much Anki you should do

Anki should always make up less time than your immersion time. You don't want to spend a lot of time in Anki because there you only need to learn a new word. To make that actually stick you need to do immersion. That's why Anki should be make up 1/5 of your daily study time. 4/5 of the time should be spent immersing.

Don't spend more than one hour in Anki.

## How many new cards should you do

General rule of thumb:
As many as your retention allows you to. Aim for at least 80% retention, anything above 90% is optimal. 
If your retention is below 80% then do less cards.
If your retention is above 90% then you can raise the amount of new cards or continue doing the same amount.

For beginners:

Start with 10 new cards a day then keep applying the general rule above. At the beginning your retention will be not good, but that's normal and you should not worry or stress about it too much for now. Your primary focus should be immersing and taking your time to understand the language.

## How much time should you spent per card

Take at absolute maximum 10 seconds per card while reviewing or doing new cards. If you can't remember something in 10 seconds, then most likely you won't remember it in 15, 30 seconds or even minutes. So fail the card if you can't remember it in that timeframe. 10 seconds is a maximum, try to aim for under 5 seconds.

## Choose an Anki Template

Every card should contain the expression you are trying to learn on the front. On the back you should have the meaning, reading, an example sentence that uses that word and pronunciation. Pronunciation is most often an audio playing, a graph on how to pronounce it or both. This is called a vocab card.

The most important parts to remember are meaning and reading. If you don't understand the meaning you mined then read through the example sentence.
For every card in Anki you learn one meaning (and reading) depending on the language at a time. 

On the front there should be no hints that can help you recall the back of the card. The goal hereby is to create a situation where you only have the word as the only information present to recall it. This way you are forced to recall the word purely based on the word itself. This also means no sentence or audio playing on the front or really anything else.

There are also sentence cards where on the front you see the whole sentence with the word you are trying to memorize. These type of cards will be easier and your retention will be higher with them than with vocab cards. Reason being, with sentence cards your brain will most likely, unconsciously or not, use the context, length and or shape of the sentence and where the word comes up in the sentence or really any unique aspect of will give you clues to help you answer thus boosting your retention rate not based on the word but on outside factors.

!!! Note "Additional material for Anki Templates"
    These are many different template for different languages, but the ones for Japanese are the most customizable and easiest to install. I would recommend [Lapis](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis). You can it for your target language if you're not studying Japanese.

## How to make remembering easier in Anki

A word should be mined according to the guidelines in [When to mine and not mine](../Mining/step 5 mine it.md#when-to-mine-and-not-mine).

Don't mine everything. Mine only expressions that you understand within the context of the sentence. Context is key, since the greater impression an expression/context has on you, the easier you will remember a word in Anki.
You can boost the impression of an expression by creating as many associations with the card you can, most prominently adding more meaningful pictures to the card. Meaningful here means anything that makes YOU remember the card more easily.

## Backlog

Usually when doing immersion you will mine more words than you will be learning each day. This will result in a backlog of cards.
For example if you mine 100 words today and do 10 new cards in Anki then you got 90 left in total. The next day you mine 100 words again and do 10 new cards in Anki then you have 180 cards and so on.

### <span style="color: var(--md-typeset-a-color);">How to manage a backlog</span>

- If you know a card already then you can suspend it. Chances are high you acquired it already through immersion.
- Try maintaining a backlog so you don't run out of Anki cards. This comes in handy when you don't have time to immerse for a day.
- Sort your new cards by frequency so you will always learn the most common used word out of your backlog. This makes sure you'll benefit faster from a newly learnt word.

## Leeches

Suspend or delete them. You'll probably encounter that expression through immersion again and again.
