You read through the sentence, check what you understand. If you there is something you don't know in a sentence or are unsure about then use Yomitan. After doing so reread the sentence, or the part that you didn't understand, with the information you looked up and see for yourself if you can understand the sentence now. 

- If you can; mine it and move on

- If you can't; spend more time trying to understand the sentence. If you can't understand the sentence, no problem, move on. 

Now rinse and repeat these steps for all sentences! This is mining!
