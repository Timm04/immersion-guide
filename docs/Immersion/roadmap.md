# What you can expect from your first immersion experience.

It will suck. You will spend a lot of time pondering on basic grammar patterns and easy words. Almost every sentence you encounter will have something new for you to analyze and think about and to mine, most often multiple things at once. This is normal! The key is here to trust the process based on what you have read so far in this guide. The more you read the easier it will become. Same goes for listening or speaking.

Similarly, the first time you sit down to watch a show in your target language will be probably be more difficult than reading. If you are not rewatching the show, then you have to focus more on whats going on in a scene, people are talking fast and you just can't keep up or properly parse what you are hearing yet. But by repeatedly doing it while also doing reading your listening ability will improve. 

# How to make Immersion easier

## Choose something you are already familiar with
By doing so you can reread or rewatch media and have an easier time picking up your target language because you're already familiar with the story and can now see how your target language expresses something you are already familiar with. This will be sort of like mapping what you already know to something new i.e your target language. 

## Choosing immersion material
The more auditory and or visual aspects a piece of media provides the more suited it is to immerse with. With immersion you basically try to use every piece of context to infer what you don't understand, this includes audio and seeing something. Especially shows are great for this because you see whats going on, you have acting or characters you can see and music you hear as well as sound effects. All of these add to the *immersion* of your immersion, and help you make scenes more impactful for you to remember some words easier.

There are many different kinds of native media you can use for your immersion. A few popular ones include: Video platforms like Youtube, streaming websites like Netflix, books, novels and comics, podcasts, music and video games. Like discussed in earlier sections, the best thing you can spend your time with to learn is 80-85% enjoyment/comprehension and 15-20% challenging, basically something you can stomach and don't mind spending a lots of time on.

## How much should you be reading and listening
For the beginning, it's a good idea to make your immersion more reading focused so you can quickly learn more vocabulary to get the most out of your listening as well. Aim for a 65-70% reading-based and 30-35% listening-based split. For more in-depth look in [Why listening is hard](types of immersion.md#why-listening-is-hard).

Generally this ratio changes a lot based on what you currently like to do. In the beginning you won't have much options in what you can immerse, which will make immersion less appealing, but your interest in learning your target language and the actual process of doing so should get you through the initial stage.

## Use subtitles
If subtitles are available for your target language then use them. As a beginner always use subtitles and mine according to [When to mine and not mine](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#when-to-mine-and-not-mine). 

## How to improve your listening as a beginner 

Look # Just read more. If you pause and try to relisten to things you heard and still don't understand them, don't be discouraged this is normal. Just [move on](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#7-move-on).

### When to stop using subtitles 

For intermediates:
Stop using subtitles if you already know most of the vocabulary and grammar you encounter in your listening material. You achieve this by [reading more](types of immersion.md#solution-just-read-more). Disable subtitles but keep them along you when listening so you can check yourself whenever you are unsure about what you heard. You will probably have to pause and relisten multiple times to a word. That's normal.

If you mine during this process more than you are actively training your listening ability i.e parsing the sounds then thats a sign to hold of listening without subtitles for now and get back to [reading more](types of immersion.md#solution-just-read-more) and subtitled listening immersion.

## Passive vs. Active Listening

Passive listening is listening to your target language without paying active attention to what you're listening to. You are not following the story or thinking about it, you are just taking in the sounds while doing something else actively like cleaning or driving. It's not entirely clear to what extent passive listening helps you learn language.
Even listing to audio at very low comprehension but still paying attention somewhat when doing a different task has unclear benefits. There are people who did a lot of passive listening and or very low comprehension audio based listening when starting out and they feel like that helped them to get used to listening itself while some say it didn't help them. 

However it is pretty clear that active listening does helps. Active listening requires you to focus on what is being said and to properly understand what is going on. Due to insufficient evidence we drop t he argument and conclude you can do passive listening if you like to, but you probably shouldn't expect to get massive benefits from it.

## A disclaimer for grammar

To start immersion, it is enough to familiarize yourself with basic grammar patterns and sentence structure of your target language. 
Further grammar study should be done periodically as you encounter new grammar structures through immersion.

If you plan to sit an general language proficiency exam in your target language that tests you on grammar, then I'd recommend to do some traditional grammar study, by using books and online grammar guides for your language. 

Usually you won't need to do this after having done immersion for months because you will have acquired most if not all nuances in grammar, word usages and reading already. After doing months of immersion you get a feeling of what feels right and what not, the same way you can feel out what feels and sounds right in your native language. This happens because of [the magic in immersion](core concepts of immersion.md#the-magic-in-immersion). But I would still recommend to brush up grammar formally for examinations that test it.

## How to improve

Challenge yourself. [The ratio](core concepts of immersion.md#the-ratio) we have discussed intends you to challenge yourself to improve. Meaning you need to expose yourself to things you don't know, go through [the process of mining](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#the-process-of-mining), do [Anki](Anki in Immersion.md#how-to-use-anki-for-immersion) to learn and remember things in the long term and most importantly do immersion where you are exposed to the things you learned in a more complex and nuanced way to build upon them thus acquiring them and repeating this whole process over and over. 

More concretely this means referencing media recommendation sheets for your target language based on difficulty. Let say you read a book with difficulty 4/10 then try to find something that is one or two steps higher while letting your interest guide you.

If the community of the language you are studying doesn't have these reference sheets, then you can do the following:

For example for reading:
1. Find something to read that interests you.
2. Make sure it's something you can justifiably stomach based on:
- Not too hard as in something like i+n, see [how i+1 is a motivating ideal but not reality](core concepts of immersion.md#how-i1-is-a-motivating-ideal-but-not-reality).
- Such that you can [check your understanding and see what you can understand for yourself](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#2-check-your-understanding-and-see-what-you-can-understand-for-yourself).
3. If not then find and repeat the process with something else.

If you think you found something that meets these criteria, then keep in mind [enjoyment as a metric for comprehension](core concepts of immersion.md#enjoyment-as-a-metric-for-comprehension) and start [the process of mining](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#the-process-of-mining).

## Why people plateau

Either they are comfortable at their level meaning they reached their goal. For example they want to be able to read novels in their target language and reached a level where they can read them without needing a dictionary. So they are satisfied and don't need to challenge themselves with listening, harder reading material or pronunciation, because that wasn't their goal in the first place.

On the other hand people plateau because they immerse with media that is similar in difficult, thus not challenging themselves. Immersing with media that is easy for you is not necessarily bad for you, it's actually good to solidify your knowledge and everything you know up until now. But if your goal is to learn and actually make progress i.e learn more words, grammar, get better at listening you need to challenge yourself. See [how to improve](#how-to-improve).

## When to drop things you are immersing with

If you are having fun, don't drop it.

If you are not having fun, then that means one of two things:
1. You understand it and it's genuinely uninteresting to you
2. You don't understand it

Drop whatever you are immersing with and switch to something easier. For reference see [enjoyment as a metric for comprehension](core concepts of immersion.md#enjoyment-as-a-metric-for-comprehension).

## How to get the most out of immersion

### How hard should you pay attention when immersing

The more carefully you break down and fully try to understand **every part** of what you're immersing with before moving on the more you get out of it.
If you do this you consistently you will progress insanely fast. People who do this usually have outstanding reading skills, passive vocab and listening comprehension, compared to people who just casually read through everything. 

Beginners that do this are usually very slow at first, painfully slow actually, breaking down everything to understand each piece before moving on. It's boring at first but eventually the most common words run out, same for grammar. This usually happens after multiple months if you are doing Anki every day and thinking about what you read.
It's not really natural to analyze every sentence and break it down fully but there are people who reached a high level by following this approach.

This approach would put you more in the problem solving mode in [the process of mining](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#the-process-of-mining) meaning you spent more time during the following steps:
Everything after 3. Use Yomitan to look up what you don't know.
4. Reread the sentence or the part where that word you just looked up appears in and try to understand the sentence.
6. Spend more time on the sentence to understand what it's trying to say.

This is per se not harmful, but rather draining, because you end up spending more time per sentence and eventually cross the rough 2 minute threshold of [how much time to spend per sentence.](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#how-much-time-to-spend-per-sentence) If you can motivate yourself through repeatedly doing this then great, but keep in mind [getting just the gist is fine](core concepts of immersion.md#getting-just-the-gist-is-fine). What matters is putting in the cognitive effort that is *trying* to understand as much as you can. How to do that is detailed [the process of mining](How to start Immersion - Mining.md#the-process-of-mining).

Generally don't get comfortable with reading just *for* the gist. What actually improves your language ability is putting effort into understand whatever you are consuming i.e breaking things down and analyzing it. The difference is in allowing yourself to get the gist sometimes but not make it become the baseline, don't settle for just the gist.
You can *get by* with just the gist always but you'll miss a lot of small details and nuances which are crucial for actually getting the most out of your immersion time. These details only unravel themselves if you don't settle for just the gist but actually pay more attention and break things down. It can be not enjoyable but it's a more straight path to get most out of your immersion time.

You can totally just read casually for the gist and break down things only when you really don't understand things, but if you want to get good fast then consistent, deep and focused reading is the way.

### Trade of between enjoyment and efficiency

Something you can sustain is important, if you're not enjoying the process then making compromises on efficiency to make it more sustainable and enjoyable for you is always worth it. On the other hand, if you're at a point where you feel very motivated to get better and are willing to make slight compromises on max enjoyment to up efficiency then that's also fine (e.g. there were some points early on like that for me where I'd swap out some non-subbed anime listening for more podcast/audiobook listening, although I stopped doing that after a few months into learning).

## General things to make things easier

Care for your health. Sleep enough. Stay hydrated. Get fresh air. Do some exercise. Even standing up, working around, doing something quick like a walk or situps in between your 5min pomodoro breaks are game changers. Sleep deprivation and dehydration cause headaches, now couple it with the fact of sitting for hours starring at screens focused, thinking hard and things can get worse. Similarity fresh air and a quick walk can really boost your capacity to acquire new information. Exercise in general improves your [cognitive ability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28666827/). Just as important is enough sleep because even [relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/). Breaking up prolonged sessions of sitting down is crucial. Same goes for your posture; your next posture is your best posture.
