# How to start Immersion - Mining

## How to learn words - Anki

Anki is a flashcard program that helps you spend more time on challenging material, and less on what you already know. You create in Anki flashcards and review them later. It uses a spaced repetition system to make you remember vasts amount of information in the long term as efficiently and underwhelming as possible. Anki does so by optimizing memory retention by showing you flashcards you created right before you forget them, maximizing retention with minimal study time. It supports powerful customization and rich media support, allowing for add-on functionality for advanced features and offline accessibility. It's extremely efficient for learning anything from languages to complex medical facts.

Using Yomitan is integral when doing immersion. Looking up things we don't know in a sentence with Yomitan and turning them into flashcards in Anki is called **mining**. Mining is **the** process we are going to be doing when dealing with sentences and trying to understand them. 

## The process of mining

To illustrate the process of how to mine, let's pretend we are learning a language called "Volga Tatar". I will use the same example sentence from [Core concepts of Immersion](core concepts of immersion.md#example-sentence). For clarity reasons, the sentence will not be written in complete Volga Tatar and instead in English and with one unknown word that is written in Volga Tatar.

"While her brother was quiet and reserved, Maria was incredibly сөйләмчәк, telling long, detailed stories at dinner, chatting easily with strangers, and always having an opinion to share." 

### 1. Read through the sentence normally. Don't panic.

You read through the sentence like you would do in your native language. This doesn't mean as fast as you can. Here you read attentively and make sure you have actually read over everything, while thinking along, trying to imagine what the sentence is saying. You may as well take mental notes as in noticing what you maybe didn't understand immediately in the sentence.

### 2. Check your understanding and see what you can understand for yourself.

In any case after having read through the sentence, good job!. Now you only move on to the next one after being sure you understood what the sentence said.

#### How to approach understanding a sentence

Being sure, means most importantly there weren't any unknown words to you or you could comprehend what the sentence is about. This doesn't mean you translate the sentence literally to yourself. It means you understand the sentence within the target language using the target language. You are basically looking to comprehend what the sentence is saying for yourself, such that *if you had to* translate the sentence you could give *your* best take at communicating what the sentence is about. You don't need to explain to yourself every time after finish reading a sentence what it tries to says, you just need to be like "Okay I get what they said". It's the same as in English where you usually don't actually pause and think about what a sentence said. You basically want to understand the sentence using your target language and using whatever appears in the sentence to understand it. You want to use as little of English as possible to understand each sentence. **After all you want to use the sentence in the target language to understand the sentence itself** like we have outlined in the i+1 sections.

#### How immersing feels

This "understanding process" should be engaging and "hard". We are putting in cognitive effort into understand the sentence with the target language. We're absorbing what we see and try to make sense of the patterns we see. It's a learning process so it's meant to be like that, thats how learning usually is.
Here you don't want to actually step back and ask yourself "How much did I understand?". You ideally want to feel a mix of enjoyment, engagement, accomplishment or excitement being interested to find out more about what ever you're reading as well as challenge and mental effort. (Remember the ratio 80-85% enjoyment and 15-20% challenge)

#### The ambiguity problem

At the beginning most things will be vague since as a beginner you have no idea if the gist is conveyed or not. You basically can't know for sure what you don't know. You most often can't really recognize *everything* you don't know or can break it down enough. To put it more frankly you can't always know whether you understood a sentence completely because you don't have enough knowledge of the target language to check yourself. This is something I refer to as the *ambiguity problem*. There will almost always be a lingering ambiguity in a given sentence you just can't grasp yet.

To give you an idea how much understanding is enough and what to aim for, here are a few examples:

98% comprehension:

You live and work in Tokyo. Tokyo is a big city. More than 13 million people live around you. You are never borgle, but you are always lonely. Every morning, you get up and take the train to work. Every night, you take the train again to go home. The train is always crowded. When people ask about your work, you tell them, “I move papers around.” It’s a joke, but it’s also true. You don’t like your work. Tonight you are returning home. It’s late at night. No one is shnooling. Sometimes you don’t see a shnool all day. You are tired. You are so tired…

95% comprehension:

In the morning, you start again. You shower, get dressed, and walk pocklent. You move slowly, half- awake. Then, suddenly, you stop. Something is different. The streets are fossit. Really fossit. There are no people. No cars. Nothing. “Where is dowargle?” you ask yourself. Suddenly, there is a loud quapen—a police car. It speeds by and almost hits you. It crashes into a store across the street! Then, another police car farfoofles. The police officer sees you. “Off the street!” he shouts. “Go home, lock your door!” “What? Why?” you shout back. But it’s too late. He is gone.

80% comprehension:

“Bingle for help!” you shout. “This loopity is dying!” You put your fingers on her neck. Nothing. Her flid is not weafling. You take out your joople and bingle 119, the emergency number in Japan. There’s no answer! Then you muchy that you have a new befourn assengle. It’s from your gutring, Evie. She hunwres at Tokyo University. You play the assengle. “…if you get this…” Evie says. “…I can’t vickarn now… the important passit is…” Suddenly, she looks around, dingle. “Oh no, they’re here! Cripett… the frib! Wasple them ON THE FRIB!…” BEEP! the assengle parantles. Then you gratoon something behind you…

In our model of 80-85% comprehension and 15-20% challenge, the range 80-85% is here the around 95% comprehension.

What matters is that **whenever you are unsure about a anything in a sentence you use Yomitan to look it up**. That's the only time you will be "translating". By looking the things you don't know in Yomitan, you're reducing the ambiguity as much as you can.  

### 3. Use Yomitan to look up what you don't know

Here you look at the definition in your dictionary what the word you didn't know means. If a word has multiple definitions only focus on the one that is actually used in the sentence.
You find this out by rereading the sentence.

### 4. Reread the sentence or the part where that word you just looked up appears in and try to understand the sentence.

Using the information you looked up from Yomitan, you reread the sentence and check your understanding again. This is where you are now in "problem solving" mode and actually should question yourself what is the sentence trying to say now that you looked up everything you think you didn't know. In the most likely case, you know feel like you understood the sentence because you looked up the missing puzzle piece(s) and reread the sentence and understood how they are used there. **After having looked up everything you don't know and understood what the sentence is trying to say you mine the word i.e add it to Anki.**

### 5. Mine the word you just understood.

Conditions you must fullfil to mine a word:

- Having gone through steps 1-4.
This means you put in effort to understand the sentence and understand it now.
Then and only then you add it to Anki.

#### When to mine and not mine

Now to make remembering the word you want to mine easier for yourself, you ask yourself if the context given is good enough for your future self to understand the word. Did this sentence, scene or context leave a big enough impression on me learning this word using that exact context. What I want to say is only mine things you understood and that have a memorable enough impression on you to remember later. If you are dealing with a sentence that has a lot of unknown words (i+n) then mining that sentence would be a bad idea because there would be too much ambiguity to actually make the context help you remember the meaning of a given word. If you got such a great context then go ahead and mine it and move on to the next sentence. If you don't then spend more time on the sentence.

You probably have experienced that "big enough impression" sentence yourself before. Maybe there was a movie you watched with a really impression lasting scene where a character said something really impactful to you which made some specific phrase or maybe just a word stick in your mind for a long time. In essence, these impactful moment i.e something you really comprehend makes a new word or phrase stick in your mind. **The stronger the context (the more you understand it) the easier time you have picking up this missing +1 piece.**

#### Avoid high frequency words

If your goal is general fluency then avoid mining high frequencies words, because they wont help you anytime soon especially as a beginner or even intermediate. The higher the frequency of the word the less likely its used and the less natural it usually sounds.

Checklist for mining:

- Gone through steps 1-4
- Don't mine things you don't understand
- Don't mine things from sentences you don't understand
- If a word has multiple definitions, only mine the definition that is used in your sentence.
- Avoid mining high frequencies words unless they interest you personally

### 6. Spend more time on the sentence to understand what it's trying to say.

#### What to do if you don't understand a sentence

If you don't understand what the sentence is trying to say even after having looked up the things you don't know, then that's *fine*. Your goal right now is to just get the gist and understand anything at all. Don't be discourage by being here, this just shows you are putting the effort you need to put in, you're learning right now. Immersion is a learning process. You will have to pause and think, reread, relisten, rewind and rethink again. **If you don't understand something after at max two or three minutes, then move on to the next sentence.**

#### How much time to spend per sentence

You generally want to spend around a one to two minutes with each sentence. You want to "problem solve" the sentences you don't understand instantly (i+1-3s) i.e look up the things you don't know (words, grammar etc.) and secondly you want pattern recognition so absorbing the *feel* of the language the flow so to speak, where you feel out common chunks of the sentence and natural sound of the language (sentence you comprehend without looking things up). You need both but when you spend too much time on a sentence, you are spending more too much time in the "problem solver" mode, even though the pattern recognition mode is what gets you to "fluency". 
Spending too much time on a sentence will just give you mental fatigue and demotivate you which can lead to burn out quicker. Its like losing the forest in the trees, where you understand every word but lose the meaning of the whole sentence/paragraph or scene. Also just frustrating to spend a lot of time every sentence.

Keep in mind this time limit is not definitive! Don't time yourself with every sentence. Just read and try to understand as much as you can.

### 7. Move on

You don't understand the sentence what so ever even after having thought about it really hard.
Move on. Don't mine it just move on. If you just don't understand a sentence even having looked up everything you can and thought about it for like 3 minutes, then you can just move on to the next sentence. You can do this because no almost no grammar pattern or word is used once. The sheer amount of immersion i.e exposure to the target language will balance out "skipping" one word or sentence. I should not even say skipping here since you didn't skip it you put in effort and just weren't able to understand it and thats part of the process, thats part of learning. That's why its not decremental to move on, because you will revisit whatever you didn't understand immediately sooner or later be it consciously when you remember from last time you saw what ever you didn't understand or unconsciously seeing that word again. Like said Immersion is not about understand everything every time 100%, its the consistency and effort that counts!

#### Last resort

As a last resort you can go and translate the sentence to your native language and get that "aha" moment to not lose track of the story or whatever form of entertainment you are immersing in. If you re reading you can just copy paste it. If you are listening then don't bother transcribing it, if it takes a lot of time as in minutes. Try to connect the meaning of the translated sentence with the sentence in your target language before continuing.

Now rinse and repeat these steps for all sentences! This is immersion!

#### Whitenoising

At step 2. You check your own understanding.
If you don't understand a sentence and **still** move on to the next sentence then thats considered whitenoising.
Moving one without having tried to understand a sentence is whitenoising and should be avoided at all costs. You learn nothing by just glossing over a sentence or letting something play in the background without paying attention. It's just a time waste.

#### Checking yourself is a good habit

Whitenoising happens to everyone, but confident people are the most prone. Confident people think they might know a word and don't bother checking themselves and move on, which can backfire. This can get to a point of learning words wrong. For example you might think you know a word because you have seen it being used so much, but actually don't know what it means. You think you know but you actually don't so you basically gaslit yourself into thinking you do. This doesn't mean you should check yourself always when immersing but once in a while doesn't hurt to avoid cases like these. 
On the other hand people who doubt themselves are not really prone to whitenoising because when they see an unfamiliar expression they usually opt to look it up. The same holds true for thinks they are unsure about, so naturally they spend more time with each given sentence. 

#### Flowing while immersing

If you think you know a word its most often better to check yourself once in a while by quickly looking it up with Yomitan. Otherwise you will experience learning a word wrong you thought you know. Being doubtful of yourself is can be one's superpower but pausing too much to check yourself can break your immersion in whatever medium. There is this balance you should keep and to illustrate this let's talk about the *flow* in immersion.

This is only applicable people who are at least advanced and intermediates. Generally if you want to improve you read at the ration discussed earlier (80-85% should be enjoyment(=comprehensive) and 15-20% should be challenging (=falling into that i+1-3 range)). Using the steps we have outlined so far we can rewrite this into 80-85% of the time immersing we should optimally spend in Step 1 and 2 (understanding sentences immediately) while 15-20% of the time we should spend in Step 3-6 (sometimes Step 7) (pausing and trying to understand a sentence thoroughly with Yomitan). This is the sweet spot where you flow, where you are immersed in whatever medium you are consuming at the moment without pausing i.e interrupting your immersion too often. Since its hard to come by a lot of sentences after each other where we get sentences like i+1, reaching the flow state is rare. But strive strive towards it.

Being confident is not bad it doesn't hurt being confident in your ability but it also doesn't hurt looking things up sometimes you think you know to check yourself. Both are good qualities but only in moderation. Be a confident and doubtful person! Check yourself once in a while!

#### Which dictionaries to use

To start out I recommend using a bilingual dictionary that uses definition in a language you understand, at best your native language. If available use multiple dictionaries to cover everything you might encounter immersing because some words are in some dictionaries while not in others.
Different dictionaries will describe the same word differently will make understanding a new word easier for you, in case you don't understand a dictionary entry.

#### When to switch to monolingual dictionaries
