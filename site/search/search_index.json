Most of the time while immersing you don't realize or feel like you are actually learning something, but you actually are, albeit unconsciously. You probably heard of the brain being referred to as a sponge and we are capitalizing on that with immersion, where we consistently expose ourself to the language in large comprehensible amounts for our brain to acquire the language naturally. </p> <p>People who are doing immersion or have done it for a long time describe that after time a certain feeling. That words just feel more right than others in certain contexts, that this conjugation is done like this and that some word has this nuanced meaning. Using and understanding your target language becomes effortless and more of a feeling based on intuition which is the highest level of proficiency one can achieve; that is native level. The same way you can feel out what feels and sounds right in your native language is trying to be accomplished with immersion.

This is because these two factors act like acceleration quirks in an engine. They accelerate language acquisition. Without these two, immersion would be just consuming content without necessarily understanding which means we would be exposed to immersion material that might be too easy or too hard for us to learn anything from, thus wasting our time and maybe even get discouraged because we are not making any substantial progress. By adding the filter of choosing material thats just at our level we can progress and acquire the language faster. </p> <p>Choosing immersion material that is also enjoyable for you makes your time learning the target language easier. It shifts your mind from \"I have to read this book to learn my target language\" to \"I want to sit down and read this book because its interesting.\" Without it, the learning process will feel forced and dragged which should be avoided at all cost. The moment when something is not interesting to you, you should stop bothering with it and switch to something different to immerse in. That is because enjoyment keeps you going, without you would be forcing yourself which is not the ideal mind space to be in when learning any skill. Somebody that enjoys what they are doing will outperform anyone that is doing the same but with no enjoyment. Ideally enjoyment should motivate you.</p> <p>These two factors make up the bottom line when choosing what to immerse in.

Even for a specific language, it is still hard to identify and define a level of proficiency that is best suited for diving into easy native material. As such, I can only say: You start when you feel ready.</p> <p>This could be after having learned the most frequent 1000 words in a language and having read through basic grammar guides. This could be done after having learned your target language to some extent in school or in language classes and you feel comfortable enough to engage with native material. This could be done after having gone through courses on websites where you learn basic phrases, grammar and vocabulary. All what matters is you having a decent foundation in the target language.</p> <p>The cleanest and most recommended path to establish said foundation is by having done an Anki deck of the most frequent used words, while having done basic grammar study alongside. If you have some experience with your target language already then going through such an Anki deck and basic grammar study nonetheless doesn't hurt.  When doing these start Anki decks, it's best to not learn any vocab but actually frequently used vocab first, because it eases your way into doing immersion. The more frequent words you know the easier your first immersion experience will be. Same goes for grammar, the more you know about your target language's grammar the easer time you will have to parse and understand it. Although this doesn't mean you should learn tons of vocab as in in the thousands and memorize every grammar pattern there is to begin with. The goal in this stage is to get a decent and rough foundation not memorize the target language. </p> <p>Language specific requirements</p> <p>Depending on your target language you might need to learn the writing system or parts of it first before going through a vocab deck in Anki.</p> <p>Start when</p> <ul> <li> <p>You know around 1000-1500 words. You could start off with less than 1k words as well but I wouldn't recommend it.</p> </li> <li> <p>You have a rough understanding of your target language's grammar. You can name and recognize things like basic grammar particles and explain how they work. You have a rough idea how of sentence structure and how your target language works.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Combining these two factors builds a foundation comfortable enough to start immersing. </p> <p>For Anki decks refer to shared decks or to your language specific immersion guide as immersion learning communities have their own starter deck and starter grammar resources.</p> <p>Giving up before it begins</p> <p>During this process you will basically be doing only Anki alongside some grammar study.

The key here is slightly! For the beginning, this means to learn as effectively as possible we should not immerse in something too easy, because there wouldn't be any new information for us to learn from it, and not immerse in something too difficult, because we wouldn't be able too understand anything at all.

That unknown piece of information (+1) can be a new grammar pattern, a new pronunciation of a known word, an idiom, or a cultural reference.

The effort is you looking up words using a dictionary and putting in cognitive effort to infer and deduce meaning based on the given information.

We do this for the following reasons:</p> <p>By deliberately allowing ourselves to be exposed to more ambiguity we will encounter words not only in different contexts like before but more importantly at different difficulties. </p> <p>For example with vocabulary, let\u2019s say one time you encounter a word in a context where you only get the gist (\u201ei+3\u201c). Then you continue immersing meaning you expose yourself more to your target language i.e learn more and get better at it. Then you maybe encounter it the next time and understand more how the word is used (\u201ei+2\u201c). Then you immerse more and finally in an \u201ei+1\u201c context you grasp its precise meaning. By consistently exposing yourself to your target language (doing immersion) you acquire it (e.x here a word sticks naturally).</p> <p>This is what learners who do immersion describe sometimes as magic. Even though you didn't consciously sit down to learn something specific for example a grammar pattern, you have developed a feeling or rather intuition how it\u2019s used and what it means, without knowing any rules why it does the things it does. And this is basically the same feeling we have with our native language, we might not be able to explain why something is right but we feel it\u2019s right we know it sounds or looks right. </p> <p>Take this sentence, for example: \u201cThe proposal didn\u2019t end up being acted upon.\u201d Now try identifying all the word classes. If you immediately recognized that this sentence contains a non-finite progressive passive formed with the \u201cact upon\u201d + preposition construction, combined with the strictly intransitive main predicate \u201cend up ~\u201d and the negated past-tense auxiliary \u201cdidn\u2019t,\u201d then awesome, good job! But most native speakers couldn\u2019t break it down like that. Does that mean they \u201cdon\u2019t really know\u201d English? Of course not. They don\u2019t need to know this and be able to recall grammatical labels or analyze structures on the spot. They can use the language naturally and effortlessly because the patterns are already wired into their intuition through immersion.

To illustrate this, I want to show you a quote that pretty much sums up immersion in slightly meme-y way yet real way:</p> <p>\"Step 1: do fun stuff</p> <p>Step 2: don't do boring stuff\"</p> <p>\u2014 Dinuz, January 2022</p> <p>This quotes here highlights one of the most if not the most important aspect of immersion. It reminds us that immersion, no language learning is at the end of the day a hobby you do for fun. While the goals for learning a foreign language might be different for everyone, the reason why people continue doing immersion does not. It's all fun after all. This is because with immersion we let our interests guide us. Unlike with school classes where we are most often forced to engage with material that is most often boring and not important to us personally in any way, with immersion we have the freedom to choose to immerse in everything we are interested in and thus enjoy it. </p>"},{"location":"Immersion/core%20concepts%20of%20immersion/#enjoyment-as-a-metric-for-comprehension","title":"Enjoyment as a metric for comprehension","text":"<p>Enjoyment is so to speak our core principle, and enjoyment is a great metric for comprehension. If you enjoy something then you probably understand enough to enjoy it, meaning it's at least something around your current language skills. If we were to take the concept of i+1 here, then i would be here your enjoyment i.e comprehension. What's great about enjoying something is that you forget about a bit of struggle or difficulty, because you'll inherently pour in more effort to understand or do that thing because it's fun, thus learn more. Enjoyment is basically the \"cheat code\", a tool we use to handle i.e get through those sentences with more ambiguity. We are driven to understand what interests us so we put in that effort comprehend it.</p> <p>If you don't enjoy immersing with something, then it might be because it's either genuinely uninteresting to you or more likely too difficult preventing you to understand. Taking the i+1 example once again, that would be a i+n sentence with a lot of ambiguity, which we want to avoid to progress.</p>"},{"location":"Immersion/core%20concepts%20of%20immersion/#the-ratio","title":"The ratio","text":"<p>To express the idea of one having immersion material that is comprehensive (=enjoyable) to you and challenging enough to learn efficiently (=i+1-3) we use the following ratio:</p> <p>80-85% should be enjoyment(=comprehensive) and 15-20% should be challenging (=falling into that i+1-3 range). This ratio ensures and encapsulates everything we have talked about so far. This ratio changes person by person. Some people may be able to tolerate more ambiguity but can still enjoy what ever they are immersing with. While some people may lose enjoyment when they don't understand as much i.e can't tolerate as much ambiguity. Both worlds are fine and justifiable, for example sometimes you may want to immerse in something thats really hard for you because you know you would enjoy it. But then the question arises if you can justify your time spent reading more difficult stuff and maybe progressing slower that reading something easier that may not be as enjoyable but would make you progress faster. How to handle this dilemma will be discussed in #. For now take away the following:</p> <p>Basically we are juggling enjoyment(=comprehensive) and challenging (=ambiguity).  To iterate again, enjoying something is another way to say you understand something enough to well enjoy it.  For something to be challenging can mean different things. Challenging can be when you know all the words but not the grammar in a sentence or vice versa. Challenging can be even when you understand every word and grammar but still need your time to understand what is actually being said for example missing some culture clue. What challenging means in immersion, is having content where most sentences, if not all, have at max 2-3 unknown pieces of information you don't know. At best every sentence has 1 unknown information, meaning the context of the sentence can help you remember the word as well, i.e the impression will be greater than if you juggle multiple unknown pieces of information in a sentence which will make the context less impactful and more vague.</p> <p>Everything comes down to your comprehension, so how do you comprehend something?

I only started to improve a lot when i started focusing on reading. I'd say the best way is to look up as much as you can stomach regardless if its listening or reading. I probably spent too much time on not looking things up, I would probably have been better of actively looking things up more.\"</p> <p>\"I'm definitely no authority on this but I think its good when beginners that don't have a big vocab (under 1.5k) do some listening in \"free flow\"-style just to get used to how the language flows and sounds. However after I finished my Anki deck to learn the most frequent used 1.5 words, I would just go full into reading cuz you get the biggest bang for your buck there IMO. You can then later come back to listening and freeflow again (or occasionally look stuff up) because now, as a beginner, you're equipped with the vocab that you acquired along the way from doing Anki and reading.\"</p> <p>\"I think doing free flow at the beginning is harmful because you don\u2019t look up stuff and just kinda take in the the words or sounds. I didn't start immersing with listening not until I had read through my first novel in my target language. I did this because if I had started off with listening then it would have been really discouraging and tedious because I would have had to stop and pause what ever I'm watching to look up things and mine them all the time. </p> <p>It justs breaks the immersion. But since I started off with reading I was able to take my time and be still immersed in what I'm reading because I can go at my own pace. Through doing reading first I started becoming comfortable with doing immersion and especially tolerating ambiguity or rather the challenging part without being discouraged.</p> <p>When I did start listening, a 20min episode usually took me 40min to get through which was for me doable, tolerable and enjoyable enough. But I couldn't imagine someone doing listening first or even during the initial stages of building a decent foundation because it just discouraging to be pausing a lot and not understand whats going on most of the time. </p> <p>Cause' eventually you feel like \"wasting\" time and thinking that this method \"isn't for me\". Whereas with reading which is more forgiving as in I can take my time and still be immersed and actually learn to understand and built trust how immersion helps develop my language skills.</p> <p>\"my specific advice about easing into things is after getting a little bit of a foundation in vocab and grammar, go for listening material where you can have subtitles in your target language, audio and the context of what is actually happening on the screen that will help boost your comprehension of things in the outset. Of course you can jump in with other things, but thats my recommended way of going about it. </p> <p>I personally dont really recommend freeflow listening to beginners because imo 1. youre only really learning from it when youre tuned into it, and  2. you need to be able to comprehend it to a certain extent, and then look up things to learn more from it, but looking things up with pure listening is hard at times (need to be able to pick out what they are saying, throw it into a dictionary,  and sometimes search for specific word depending on whether it has other words that sound the same but use different letter or symbols when written)\"</p> <p>\"I'd recommend listening however you're comfortable. Prioritize amount of content and amount of fun you're having over all else. Read when you feel like it and want to go slower and learn individual words, listen, when you feel like it to develop your unconscious comprehension of the language.\"</p> <p>\"Generally speaking listening is going to be way way harder for a beginner than reading because there is an added layer of complexity with training your ears to properly parse the sounds into characters in your head and then have to translate those characters into words. </p> <p>In order to most efficiently acquire a language (and learn anything for that matter) you require the right ratio of new info to info you already know, like how its much easier to learn multiplication if you already know addition and the number system. the ideal ratio is at a point where you should ideally be able to comprehend almost all of the media that you're consuming so that when something comes up that you dont understand you can use the context from the rest of the passage that you do understand to quickly learn the new word/phrase/grammar. </p> <p>In order to acquire new things you must first understand the message that the passage is attempting to convey, then your brain is able to (through lots of exposures to that new word/phrase/grammar) slowly build up a nuanced understanding of the role that said word plays in any given scene.\"</p> <p>\"If you can read something well, listening becomes way easier. It\u2019s important to remember that if you can read a word, recognizing it by ear won\u2019t be that hard. But yeah, the language community in general is really tilted toward reading people tend to get much better at that than listening. Still, there are many who balance both, and that\u2019s what I think is ideal. Reading and listening aren\u2019t two separate skills from different worlds; they go hand in hand and should be developed together. </p> <p>There\u2019s no \u201cfirst you only read, then you only listen.\u201d For example, in my case, I only listened at the start. I barely read anything. I can\u2019t really call it a mistake because I had my reasons for doing it that way, but from a learning perspective yeah, that was probably not the best approach. If you read for a few days and then switch to listening, you\u2019ll instantly feel how much easier it is to catch words in context ones you wouldn\u2019t have noticed just by ear. Reading builds your passive language ability, and listening turns that into active understanding.</p> <p>I honestly don\u2019t think you can build a really strong foundation only through endless listening. It\u2019ll be slower and harder. It\u2019s much better to do both maybe like 60% reading and 40% listening  until you feel like listening is lagging behind, then just increase your listening time. That\u2019s what I figured out for myself after about a year and a half.\"</p> <p>Now having read through all of these accounts, you probably feel confused since everybody seems to contradict themselves or one another. What should you do now and how should you start immersion? As you can see you can do immersion in many different ways.

Don't worry about 2 years or 10 years or 5 years. Just 10 goals, you would like to accomplish in the next 12 months and write them in the present tense. Almost like you're submitting an order. For example use phrases like this:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"I can\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I know\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I have\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I earn\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I achieve\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I weigh\" </p> </li> <li> <p>\"I drive\"</p> </li> <li> <p>\"I own\"</p> </li> </ul> <p>Whatever your goals will be it family goals or physical or mental goals, when you got that list of 10, take it and imagine if you had a magic wand and you could wave this magic wand and could have any one goal on your list within 24 hours.

This is just a matter if you want or not. </p> <p>I cannot stress enough how imperative it is to be motivated especially with language learning and especially with immersion where you are responsible for yourself.

Method doesn't matter if you got plenty of time. You can acquire a language by using the most inefficient method there is if you study with it for long enough like 10 years. But if you use the right method you save yourself a lot of time. Without motivation you won't stick.</p> <p>Notice how the list doesn't include intelligence, being healthy or young. These things don't matter. You can be doubtful, confident, stressed, feeling down, joyful, depressed but you must be motivated.

Not to speak of how a Japanese person would have the same kind of problem understanding why even use a definite article to begin with since the Japanese language doesn't have an article. </p> <p>These \"difficulties\" are not difficulties for natives, since they have been ingrained and reinforced over a long time into their brains; they didn\u2019t know it otherwise.

Students will usually start speaking in a foreign language relatively early around grade 3 to 4, aged 8-10, using simple phrases, greetings and classroom language like \"Can I go to the toilet?\". Teachers also speak almost completely in English while in class. As one advances to higher classes we observe speaking becoming more task-based, think of dialogues, role-plays, presentations and discussions.

That system makes sense in an education system, not in a language acquisition framework. This plays part in a phenomenon where students after graduation can't really functionally use the language anymore they learned in school. They can pass exams using the language that was taught to them in school but are unable to retain or use them fluently. We call this foreign language attrition.</p> <p>There is a good chance you have experienced the result of this education system as well. I know I have. I had English since elementary school and had to eventually pick my second foreign language in middle school. The flavor of chaos I picked was French; four years long.

Yet, after graduation, all my years of doing grammar drills, memorizing all the vocab and participating in the speaking tasks magically vanished just like they have been doing after every exam.

We now established the general language learning method applied in education systems. We understand what it tries to achieve and how it mostly goes about it. But how should we now perceive the traditional method as a language learning method as a whole. To do this, we are gonna look at the merits and demerits of the tradition method.</p> <p>One of the best things it provides is that, there is a teacher who ideally teaches and helps you understand. And that person you can ask really anything and they will help you. For example, when you speak in the foreign language, they can correct you and your peers, essentially getting real time feedback. On the other hand, a teacher can't always be there and correct your pronunciation or grammar, especially when there are multiple people speaking. So there is also a danger of forming bad habits when speaking if you're not getting constant feedback. To add to that; being in classroom like environment with a teacher may take away some independency, because the teacher usually dictates what you learn. You'll rarely have a choice but to read a most often a text about something you're not interested in. Sometimes you might want to the teacher to review a certain topic or to jump ahead a few chapters because you understand it already, but the teacher usually won't do that because the others might not be at the same level yet. So there is this set pace you most often have to go by in order to progress in the language.</p> <p>Something it does well is the social aspect; being in an environment with people who are trying to achieve the same goal as you are. Ideally, you'll help each other be it by teaching what you have learned or just having the company of another. Being in a group of people sharing the same goal, not only improves your own work ethic but also makes learning more memorable and fun.  While this sounds idealistic in text, reality can be different and not everyone might be willing to participate in class or pay attention or even worse, disturb each other and not learn something in result. One might think back to the time nostalgic; sitting in last row in class with your friends, banting and playing around and not having learning anything at the end of class, but this approach won't make you learn a language.</p> <p>It's also worth noting exams which are like measurable benchmarks for progress. Ideally students get motivated by their results and try to improve for next time. Especially by being in a classroom like setting, a sense of community is created where you work towards a shared goal with others, which makes overcoming challenges easier. However one could also get discouraged depending on how an exam goes. Not to mention, having to take an exam can lead to just studying enough of the foreign language to get a passing grade or worse not studying at all and cheating. This can lead to something thats called inert knowledge where students may be able to memorize and recall information but struggle to actually use it in new situations.</p>"},{"location":"Tradtional%20methods/Methods/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>All in all I think I mentioned enough points speaking for and speaking against the traditional method, allowing us evaluate the method as a whole. When evaluating a language learning method we should keep in mind these points:</p> <ol> <li> <p>You actually acquire the language to your desired level. When learning a language you need to define for yourself what you want to achieve by learning it. Do you want to be conversationally fluent or be able to read books without dictionaries or do you just want to watch youtube and shows without any problems. A method should reflect these goals. Thats why a method should actually make you acquire the language to your desired level.</p> </li> <li> <p>The time it takes to reach 1. The time it takes to reach your goal is also important. Optimally we want to reach our goals as fast as we can without paying the price of burnout or wasting our time, which is why the time it takes to reach your desired level must be considered as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>The fun you're having I mention enjoyment here as an aspect because in general if you have fun doing something you will have a significantly easier time doing it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Based on the arguments I presented so far we can safely conclude that traditional methods have their place in education teaching students about foreign languages. But as outlined it can result in students not actually being able to be proficient at that language. For me it wasn\u2019t until I stepped outside the classroom and its language-learning textbooks that I discovered personal interests, through watching YouTube or playing video games, where I truly began to use the language and started becoming fluent.  The traditional method is language education first and language acquisition second.  Most of the pros I mentioned only manifest themselves if one has the motivation to learn a foreign language. Not a superficial interest but a real personal goal they can strive towards and be motivated by. No students wants to spent hours every day for years discussing and reading about school and migration problems, cultural differences or how a political system elsewhere work in a foreign language. One would get way more motivated if they could actually engage with material/media important to them. </p>"},{"location":"Tradtional%20methods/Methods/#the-bottom-line","title":"The bottom line","text":"<p>Someone who is interested in something will inherently pour in more effort into something than someone who is not interested in that same thing.
